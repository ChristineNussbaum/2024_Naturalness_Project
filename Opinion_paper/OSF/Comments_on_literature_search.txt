Comments on literature search

Please note that we performed a literature search with two search terms only ("naturalness" and "human-likeness"). This raises the question, to which degree the literature search is biased, because it might neglect relevant publications which used different, but conceptually related keywords. Please note that this is not a fully systematic literature search, so it was not the aim to exhaustively identify all publications that fit the inclusion criteria. Nevertheless, the identified literature ideally should capture the full scope of current voice naturalness research, which calls for an assessment to which degree the search was limited by our choice of keywords. We adressed this by running some additional searches in Web of Science (in October 2024) with different keywords. For each search, we checked how many of our included papers would be listed in the results: realism AND voice” (5 publications), “anthropomorphism AND voice” (6), “artificial* AND voice” (10), “normal* AND voice” (3), “accept* AND voice” (9), “clarity AND voice” (3), “ease* AND voice” (3), and  “quality AND voice” (19). This way, we show that research from all these keywords is represented in our literature overview. The only exception is “authent* AND voice,” which picked up 0 of our naturalness papers. This is because we made an explicit effort to keep the concepts of naturalness and authenticity separate. In summary, we conclude that our literature search resulted in a representative overview of voice naturalness publications.
