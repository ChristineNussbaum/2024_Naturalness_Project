This Project contains the following components and files: 

### Literature Overview ###

- "Naturalness_included_literature_72_publications.pdf" -> the reference list of the 72 naturalness publications which were included in our mini-review in alphabetical order
- "Voice_Theory_included_literature_10_publications.pdf" -> the reference list of the 10 publications on voice theory that we used for the VOSviewer analysis in alphabetical order
- "Literature_overview_72_publications.xlsx" -> a detailed overview of the 72 naturalness publications 
- "Definitions of Naturalness.pdf" -> a compilation of voice naturalness definitions that we could identify from the publications, all direct quoted from papers
- "Descriptive_Analysis_72_publications.R" -> an R-Script that uses the Excel-Sheet "Literature_overview_72_publications.xlsx" as input and extracts the descriptive information reported in "Box 1: A field in numbers" of the manuscript. 
- "Comments_on_literature_search.txt" -> a few explanatory background information about the rationale of the literature search and a reflection on potential biases

### Word Clouds ###

- "Link_to_ChatGPT_promt.txt" -> contains the link to the ChatGPT conversation that generated the wordlist on April 29, 2024
-"ChatGPT_WordCloud_input.xlsx" -> The list generated by ChatGPT for the Wordcloud in Figure 1B. It is used as input for the R-Script "Wordclouds_naturalness.R".
- "Wordclouds_naturalness.R" -> the R-Script generating the two wordclouds "Fig1A_wordcloud_synonym_from_literature.png" and "Fig1B_wordcloud_synonym_ChatGPT.png". It needs as input two excel files: "ChatGPT_WordCloud_input.xlsx" and "Literature_overview_72_publications.xlsx" (from the OSF component "Literature Overview")
- "Fig1A_wordcloud_synonym_from_literature.png" -> the wordcloud from Figure 1A in the manscript, generated by the script "Wordclouds_naturalness.R" based on synonyms extracted from the scientific literature
- "Fig1B_wordcloud_synonym_ChatGPT.png" -> the wordcloud from Figure 1B in the manscript, generated by the script "Wordclouds_naturalness.R" based on synonyms generated by ChatGPT
- "Comments_on_the ChatGPT_analysis.txt" -> a few explanatory background information about the rationale of the ChatGPT prompt and a reflection on potential biases

### VOSviewer Network ###

- "Step_by_Step_Documentation.pdf" -> a detailed documentation with screenshots how the VOSviewer visualization (Figure 1C in the manuscript) was created.
- "input_publication_metadata.zip" -> the input for VOSViewer, from which the visualization was created. It contains the metadata of the 72 naturalness publications and the 10 voice theory papers
- "Naturalness_VOSViewer_map.txt" and "Naturalness_VOSViewer_network.txt" -> the created network. These two files can be loaded into VOSviewer to get the interactive network figure. 
- "Fig1C_Naturalness_VOSViewer_visualitation.png" -> the resulting network visualization as a screenshot, included as Figure 1C in the manuscript
