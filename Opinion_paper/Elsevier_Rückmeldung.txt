I have nothing but praise for the whole publication process with Trends in Cognitive Sciences. The correspondence with the Editor was always very friendly, helpful and super professional. Thank you very much!

However, I am disappointed by the way I am treated as an author by Elsevier. The paper published contains several years of hard work. On top, we paid 6450€ publication fee. In addition, we were asked whether we would contribute the cover illustration of the respective issue, and we happily did (for free). When the issue was published, I asked whether it was possible to receive a printed copy of the issue and I was forwarded to Elseviers customer service where I was informed that I am to pay >300€ for a printed copy of an issue that contains OUR work, OUR cover and is partly paid by OUR institution. I consider this quite disrespectul towards the authors, who in the end bring the value to these issues via their work. I do fully understand that publication and also printing comes with costs. But I would consider it a natural courtesy that the authors (and illustrators) of an issue receive as copy of their work, simply as a matter of respect. From what I understand, this is the norm in the publishing business.
