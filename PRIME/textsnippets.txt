I originally planned to submit my PRIME application last year already, but changed my plans when entering a very complicated pregnancy in Summer 2024. A months-long cascade of complications, emergency surgery, and finally a life-threatening amniotic infection syndrome left no other option than the termination of the pregnancy after 18 weeks in September 2024, followed by a prolonged recovery period. This has severely affected my academic plans in the second half of 2024: I postponed the PRIME application by one year, the publication of my review "Understanding voice naturalness" got delayed until the beginning of 2025 and I could not start my work on a prospective DFG proposal as planned. My scientific community provided exceptional support through this difficult time, for which I am very grateful.
